Prepare to elevate your technical skills  and showcase innovation in Autonomous UAV development challenge .This is a payload dropping event that aims to assess participants abilities in designing,simulating,implementing,and demonstrating autonomous multirotor systems.The objective of the competition is to design and fabricate a multirotor which is capable of lifting the payload of 0.25 kg.All the operations “from takeoff -dropping-landing “will be completely autonomous.General instructions:1. Team must bring their multirotor in the dismantled form and assemble in the venue provided.2. Participants are required to submit detailed documentation outlining their multirotar designs,including mission objectives,autonomous capabilities,simulation results,and safety measures.3. There will be two rounds in the competition .4. Team should contain minimum of 2 members and maximum of 5 members\n",
